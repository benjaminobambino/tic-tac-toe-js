### ***Description***
#### This was my homework assignment after five days of class at General Assembly&rsquo;s Software Engineering Immersive course: I had one weekend to create a fully functional tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulationâ€”after just learning JS that week!
#### You&rsquo;ll notice two different JS files: one using the initial JS we had used up to that point and another using high order functions.
